## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] User can **successfully add and remove items**from the todo list
* [ ] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item**and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* [ ] User can **persist todo items** and retrieve them properly on app restart
* [ ] Successfully push code to github. Also can see code on github
* [ ] Includes a readme with a GIF walkthrough of the app's functionality
* [ ] Created an issue on the repo to include //cc @codepathreview @codepath in the issue body

The following **optional** features are partially  implemented:

* [ ] PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED : Persist the todo items into SQLite instead of a text file. Please find TASKDBHandler and Tasks classes. As of now the application utilizes a normal text file

## Notes

Even though I was able to implement the SQLLite in a different application, I had troubles when integrating with the todo application.
